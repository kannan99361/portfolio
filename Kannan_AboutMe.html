            My name is Darshani Kannan and I am current Freshmen at Dublin Highschool!  I pursue the realms of Business and engineering. My interest has grown immensely over the past few overs for modern technology and as early in my journey, I am willing to learn and grow as a student and as a learner. The coding world fascinated me and with both my parents as professional engineers, it has engrossed me even more! My passion and love for computer science began in seventh grade where I took PLTW Computer Science; it has taught me greatly on the bases of computer language, flowcharts, coding, etcâ€¦ We learned the proper methods of coding; making a postive impact on  modern tech and society."Only a life lived for others is worth living"- Albert Einstein. This quote really helped shaped my life because I always enjoyed helping people ever since my early childhood and creating a postive change accomplishes one of my goals in life. I believe you have to love and stand for yourself as well as others.
            In the future, I see myself with big software business which will hopefully make an impact on the world and who I am as a person. To get there I am planning on joining many clubs such as DECA in which will help me enrich my career in business. As a freshmen I am still exploring the different courses they offer here at Dublin. Some of my qualifications are that I masterd over leadership qualities and most definitely teamwork. Over the past few years in many projects in which I have contributed, I learned how to understand and learn from my peers which are a great skills to have especially business management. In the next 4 adventurous years of my high school career, I hope to get educated in interested in the engineering routes. The best way to contact me is through email. Thank you for the time and enjoy reading the rest of my website! </p></strong></left></align>
