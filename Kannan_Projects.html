    <center><p> In computer science class we have executed a project by creating an app through MIT app inventer. In this database, my partner and I have both equally contributed on developing an app called Get the Gold, where the objective of the game is for the user to get all the coins and under a restricted amount of time. This determines their score and whether they won the game or not. The app has many functions and capabilities, and depending if the user loses they may restart or they may continue into the next level. We also many images and sprites!  We have faced some coding challenges, but we have learned from our mistakes and understood the different ways to use code; how to build and execute an app using our coding and computer science knowledge. There are a couple of failures as some of our sprites ended crashing or our code wasn't right etc...We have also learned basic skills such as time management, problem solving, teamwork etc...In this project my role was to develop the app through coding and documenting our progress.  Overall I have learned many things about the basics of creating and app!</center></p>

      <p><u><li> Duration: August 2016- May 2017</u></p></li>
      <p><u><li> Project Type: Group Project:(7 students)</u></p></li>
       <p></strong>About 3 years ago, during my time in middle school I have participated and contributed to an global and world-wide organization known as Destinaton Imagination(DI).In this organization a bunch of students team up and find a solution to any problem in public throughout aspects of design, engineering, community service etc...Our team decided to help find a solution for kids with chemotherapy and to do that our team had to master the art of architural design to find a a way to present our solution. Each member had to make sure they mastered the arts of mechanical work and team building for a better cause. In this project I had to make sure the team is working well with each oher manage the overall bases of the team and helping in building the physical part of the project. I had many challenges along the way as I was new to certain things but because of those difficult times I was able to better learn and grow. This project truly enhanced my passion for public service and it taught me basics of mechanical engineering.</p></strong>
